# Example: Content Writing

## Before Lean
**User:** "draft an email"

**Agent:** "To whom? About what? Formal or casual?"

**Result:** Multiple rounds to clarify

---

## With Lean

**User:** "draft an email"

**Agent (Internal):** *Optimizes to:*

<task>Email Drafting</task>
<action>Since context is missing, ask ONE consolidated question:
"Who is this for and what's the main message? 
(e.g., 'To investors about Q1 results' or 'To team about deadline')"
</action>

**Agent:** "Who is this for and what's the main message?"

**User:** "To investors about our new product"

**Agent:** *[Generates perfect email immediately]*

**Savings:** Reduced from 4+ rounds to 2 rounds
